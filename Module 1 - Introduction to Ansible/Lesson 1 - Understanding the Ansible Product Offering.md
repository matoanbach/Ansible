# 1.1 Understanding Ansible
## What is Ansible
- Ansible is software for configuration management
- It uses modules in YAML files to describe the current state of managed systems
- Using Ansible commands, the desired state is compared to the current state of managed systems
- If a difference occurs, Ansible will update the current state with the desired state

## How it works
- Ansible is designed to be simple
- It is developed on top of Python, and uses manifest files written in YAML
- Ansible uses Secure Shell (SSH) to reach out to the managed systems and apply the desired state
- It uses no agents
- You can use Ansible to manage a wide range of different platforms
