# 16.1 Before you Start: Essential Tips
- All Ansible documentation is available on the exam. Make sure you practice finding the appropriate documentation; it sometimes is well hidden.
- You don't have to use `ansible-navigator`. All assignments can also be done through `ansible-playbook` and other older tools.
- According to Red Hat exam philosophy, it doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you're doing the right thing.
- Avoid non-idempotent behavior as much as you can
- You think better behind your coffe machine. During the exam you may have 3 breaks, use them!
- Read the "essential information" section very carefully; it has essential information.
- Make suer you are very comfortable with the following:
  - Using roles, collections, and requirements files
  - Using conditionals
  - Using block and rescue
- All tasks expect you to create a working solution. If needed, install packages, create users, start services, and more to ensure the playbook solution will work.
